        <dd>One-Day Internationals, also known as ODIs, are a faster format.
            <br>Unlike a test match which can last up to five days, a one-day match takes place over a day's play, hence
            the name.
            Whichever team bats first is required to post a score in up to 50 overs and then the other team is tasked to
            <i><strong>chase down that total within 50 overs</strong></i>.
